# dots
My (new new) dotfiles

## Requirements

I work on many different operating systems and
want my dotfiles to work flawlessly in as many of them as possible.

Because of this, there is a limit on what tools can be used.
My previous dotfiles depended on GNU Stow for example, which isn't readily available everywhere (I believe Alpine Linux used to be one of those places).
Thus, I will try to prevent using tools like these.

## How to use

Run the `installer.sh` script.

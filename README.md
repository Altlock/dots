# dots
My (new) dotfiles

## Software required:

* Vim-plug for nvim

## How to use

Just put the files you want into your home directory after you installed the prerequisites.
If you just want the whole shebang, you can clone this repo to your `~`.

## Adding a file to the repository

Since every single file ever is ignored by default, you need to force a file into the repository:

``git add -f dir/file``
